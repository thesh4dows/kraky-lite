# Kraky-lite

Kraky lite is a smaller version of kraky focused only on wifi, bluetooth and sub-GHz frequencies.
I've decided to do it so i can learn SMD sodering with a simpler project. 
This project can be used for learning the basics of wifi, bluetooth and sub-GHz frequencies attacks and protections.
